Exercise 4: Calculating the rough molecular weight of human insulin using the given code
In this lab, you will calculate the molecular weight of insulin, which you will work with in later labs.

Ensure that your .py file is open

Copy the following code, and at the end of the .py file, paste it.

# Calculating the molecular weight of insulin  
# Creating a list of the amino acid (AA) weights  
aaWeights = {'A': 89.09, 'C': 121.16, 'D': 133.10, 'E': 147.13, 'F': 165.19,
'G': 75.07, 'H': 155.16, 'I': 131.17, 'K': 146.19, 'L': 131.17, 'M': 149.21,
'N': 132.12, 'P': 115.13, 'Q': 146.15, 'R': 174.20, 'S': 105.09, 'T': 119.12,
'V': 117.15, 'W': 204.23, 'Y': 181.19}  
# Count the number of each amino acids  
aaCountInsulin = ({x: float(insulin.upper().count(x)) for x in ['A', 'C',
'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T',
'V', 'W', 'Y']})  
# Multiply the count by the weights  
molecularWeightInsulin = sum({x: (aaCountInsulin[x]*aaWeights[x]) for x in
['A', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'P', 'Q', 'R',
'S', 'T', 'V', 'W', 'Y']}.values())  
print("The rough molecular weight of insulin: " +
str(molecularWeightInsulin))
Save and run the file.

Notice the resulting output. You will use elements of this code to work with loops and functions in other labs, so observe how the code is written and try to follow the expected output.

Note: The actual molecular weight of human insulin is 5807.63, but the program delivers 6696.42 because it ignores certain bonds and post-translational processing. To calculate the error percentage:error percentage = (| measured â€“ accepted | / accepted)*100%

Enter or copy the example into your script.

molecularWeightInsulinActual = 5807.63
print("Error percentage: " + str(((molecularWeightInsulin - molecularWeightInsulinActual)/molecularWeightInsulinActual)*100))
To see the error percentage, run and save the file.

Note: When you use string concatenation with floating point calculations, the print() function returns an error. This error is handled by a method called casting, which tells Python to use a certain data type. The previous use of the str() function is an example of casting.

Congratulations! You have worked with variables and different data types in a Python function.
