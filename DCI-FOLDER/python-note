## python cod
first create a file  
- list.py
   myfruitlist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry]      # this is called list in python, 
                                                     #we can say list of fruilt
                                                     # "myfruitlist is a variable
     print(myfruitlist)       # this will display all the value in the variable called myfruitlist
     print(type(myfruitlist))  # this will tell which data type is this? list
     print(myfruitlist[0])    # this will print the first value of the variable myfruitlist
     print(myfruit[1])    #  # this will print the second value of the variable myfruitlist
     print(myfruitlist[2])    # this will print the third value of the variable myfruitlist

     run the code = python3 list.py

     ## change value of a list in a variable
     myfruitlist[2] = "orang"   # this will go to the variable value number them the 
                                 first value is always zero when it get to the list with value 2 it will replace with our new value
    print(myfruitlist)   # this is to print again the value in the variable 
                           myfruitlist and u will see that orrang has replace CHERRY   
    RUN python3 list.py     

 ## exercise2
 - create a file call tuple.py
    # tuple is a function in python just like list just that with list u can make changes on the variable value but with tuple u can not make any changes
    code 
         myfinalanswertuple = ("apple" ,"banana", "pinaple")
         print(myfinalanswertuple)    # this will tell which type of function is this? list
        print(type(myfinalanswertuple))   # this will tell which type of function is this? list  
    print(myfinalanswertuple[0])    # this will print the first value of the variable myfruitlist
     print(myfinalanswertuple[1])    #  # this will print the second value of the variable myfruitlist
     print(myfinalanswertuple[2])    # this will print the third value of the variable myfruitlist
                                            
   run python3 tuple.py



# exercise3   
# dictionary start with a carin bracket and end with carin bracket ie {}

  code 
      myfavoriteDictionary = {
        "akwa" = "apple"
        "sonia" = "banana"
        "paulo" = "pinaple"
      }
    print(myfavoriteDictionary)  
    print(type(myfavoriteDictionary))  
     print(myfavoriteDictionary["akwa"])  # to print akwa
      print(myfavoriteDictionary["sonia"]) 
        print(myfavoriteDictionary["paulo"])  

   run python3 dictionary.py


   # exercise 4
   # creating a mixed type list
   creat a file call mixedlist.py
    code
        mymixedtzpelist = [45, 373567, 1.02, true, "my dog is on the bed.", "45" ]     
        for items in mymixedtzpelist:
           print ("{}is of the data type {}".formate(item,type(item)))  # this will print the data type for each item on the above list
 run   python3 mistlist.py
