 this is  one of the k8s loadbalancing service type
  explanation, when we build and app it is always with frontend and backen, and the frontend is what customer are seeing in public, if we are require to put a loadbalancer then we will go with <external loadb> . with the backend app that talks with the frontend through their api , in this case if we are require to put a loadb in any of the backend app then we can put <cluster ip loadbalancer>

  another example wordpress application we need to put external loadbalancer  while database application will can put internal loadB<cluster ip)>
