                    name: wap
                data:             # bellow variable we have store to be call in other deployment
                  port: "80"
                  color: "green"
                  env: "dev"

- To execute RUN <kubectl apply -f configmap.yaml>   
                 <kubectl decribe configmap wap>   

#   illustrate of the above
       create file pod.yaml

                  apiVersion: v1
                  Kind: pod 
                  metadata:
                      name: configmap-pod
                  spec:
                     containers:
                       - name: nginx
                         image: nginx
                         ports:
                            - containerPort: 80
                         env:

                 <kubectl get pod>  
- To print all env variable in a pod/container RUN <kubectl exec -it configmap-pod -- printenv>
