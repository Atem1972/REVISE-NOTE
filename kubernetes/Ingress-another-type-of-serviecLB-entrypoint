charges. we use ingress to limite the number of external services. but i did not set that up



## is this correct about ingress , what is really this ingress? i know ingress is to avoid having multiple service in the cluster which have type loadbalancer and it is expensive interms of cloud

You're absolutely on the right track, and your understanding is mostly correct. Let's refine it a bit so you have a clear and accurate picture:

‚úÖ What is Ingress, Really?
Ingress in Kubernetes is not a service itself, but a Kubernetes object that defines how external HTTP/HTTPS traffic should be routed to internal services.

Think of it like a traffic director that handles incoming requests and sends them to the right place inside your cluster‚Äîbased on things like the URL path or domain name.

üîç Why Use Ingress?
Yes, as you said:

Using Ingress helps avoid creating multiple LoadBalancer services, which is expensive in cloud environments like AWS, GCP, or Azure.

You're absolutely right. Here's why:

Without Ingress:
You want to expose 5 different web services.

Each service uses type: LoadBalancer.

Each one spins up its own external IP (and load balancer).

Result: 5 load balancers = high cost üí∏

With Ingress:
All 5 services are exposed via one LoadBalancer (the Ingress Controller).

You define routing rules based on path or hostname.

Result: 1 load balancer, multiple services served = cost-efficient ‚úÖ

üí° Analogy
Imagine a single receptionist (Ingress Controller) at the front desk of an office:

Visitors say who they want to meet (myapp.com/login, myapp.com/api).

The receptionist directs them to the correct office (the correct internal service).

Instead of hiring 10 receptionists (one per service), you use one smart receptionist with a rulebook (Ingress rules).

üîß Behind the Scenes
Components:
Ingress Resource: The YAML file where you define the routing rules.

Ingress Controller: The actual software (e.g., NGINX, Traefik) that reads the rules and handles the traffic.

You must deploy an Ingress Controller in your cluster to make Ingress work‚Äîjust creating an Ingress object won't do anything by itself.

üîÑ Example Use Case
yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: web-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: myapp.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /api
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: api-service
            port:
              number: 80
      - path: /login
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: login-service
            port:
              number: 80
With this:

Requests to myapp.com/api go to api-service

Requests to myapp.com/login go to login-service

And it's all happening behind a single external IP (your Ingress Controller's LoadBalancer).

‚úÖ Final Summary
‚úîÔ∏è Ingress: Defines routing rules for incoming HTTP(S) traffic

‚úîÔ∏è Works with an Ingress Controller

‚úîÔ∏è Helps you avoid multiple LoadBalancers, saving cost

‚úîÔ∏è Supports TLS, path-based routing, and domain-based routing

‚ùå Not a replacement for Service, but works alongside them



























































In Kubernetes (K8s), Ingress is a Kubernetes API object that manages external access to services in a cluster, typically over HTTP and HTTPS.

What does Ingress do?
An Ingress:

Acts as an entry point into your Kubernetes cluster.

Provides routing rules to direct external traffic to internal services.

Supports features like TLS termination, virtual hosting, path-based routing, and rewrite rules.

Key Concepts
Ingress Controller: A separate component that implements the rules defined in Ingress resources. Common ones include:

NGINX Ingress Controller

Traefik

HAProxy

AWS ALB Ingress Controller

Ingress Resource: A YAML object where you define routing rules.

Simple Example
yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: myapp.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: my-service
            port:
              number: 80
This rule tells the Ingress Controller:

Route HTTP traffic for myapp.example.com to the service named my-service on port 80.

Why use Ingress?
Centralized routing config

More efficient than exposing each service via LoadBalancer or NodePort

Supports TLS/SSL termination

Enables clean URLs and domain-based routing

Great! Let's dive deeper into how Ingress compares to other service types in Kubernetes, and how you can use it to set up TLS (SSL) for secure HTTPS access.

üîÅ Ingress vs Other Service Types in Kubernetes
1. ClusterIP
Default service type

Exposes the service only within the cluster

Not accessible from the outside world

Use case: internal communication between pods/services

2. NodePort
Exposes the service on a static port on each Node‚Äôs IP

Can be accessed via <NodeIP>:<NodePort>

Simple but limited control, and usually not production-grade

3. LoadBalancer
Provisions an external load balancer (e.g., AWS ELB, Azure LB)

Each service gets its own public IP

Costly if you have many services needing external access

4. Ingress
Single entry point for multiple services

Routes requests based on domain or URL path

Can terminate SSL/TLS

Works with an Ingress Controller

Most flexible and scalable for HTTP/HTTPS traffic

üîê Setting Up TLS with Ingress
Prerequisites
You have a domain (e.g., example.com)

TLS certificate (via Let's Encrypt or manually issued)

A running Ingress Controller (e.g., NGINX)

Step-by-step TLS Setup Example
Create a TLS Secret

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl create secret tls my-tls-secret \
  --cert=cert.pem \
  --key=key.pem \
  --namespace=default
Create an Ingress with TLS

yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-secure-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - myapp.example.com
    secretName: my-tls-secret
  rules:
  - host: myapp.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: my-service
            port:
              number: 80
This config does:

HTTPS termination at the Ingress level using your TLS cert

Routes https://myapp.example.com traffic to my-service on port 80

Optional: Auto TLS with Let's Encrypt (using cert-manager)
If you're using cert-manager, you can automate certificate issuance and renewal using annotations like:

yaml
Copy
Edit
metadata:
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
This works with Ingress Controllers that support cert-manager.
