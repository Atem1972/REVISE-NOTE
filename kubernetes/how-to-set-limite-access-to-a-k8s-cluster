some of the question u will be ask is how do u secure ur cluster? 
- by given limited access to user of the cluster, we can use namespace to limite every to their own area, and will set limitation to their namespace
- we can use <(RBAC ie ROLE BASE AECCESS CONTROL) access, air dapt,active directory  to give limited access to the cluster>
 . WE HAVE ADMIN LEVEL ACCESS :      they have permition  to node, admin processes <then we will create cluster role to be able to do this?
  . AND NAMESPACE  : but if we are using but namespace to limit the acccess <then we will create ROLE to do this> 
                          - creat a role
                          - create service account(SA) link it to the role
                          - generate token
                          - creat a config file, save it to ~.kube/config, what ever access we put here for user is what he or she will have


- air dapt: lets say we have 1000 servers machine , and will need to add user john to all the machine . than to be login in to each of the machine adding john , it will be stressful, but we can add all those servers on the air dapt and on the air dapt we can create a user john and he will have access to all the 1000 servers. it is a centralise place to manage user in a company
- active directory: it is a centralise user place,
- NB note that in the cluster the is no way to manage user and group, if u most do it then , u most do it externally
