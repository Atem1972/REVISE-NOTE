what is a daemon set? it is one of the Kind in k8s object, where u say execute this my applicetion  one pod per node ie if i need my application to replicate 5 pods/container , please put each pod per node

- we can also use this daemonset kind to agregate logs ie collecting logs meassages from all our pod and asemble them somewhere for us to have a look
 # some other tools we can use to monitor the cluster and collect logs(agrigate logs) are promitus and grafana

example:
  create a file daemonset.yaml
         
           apiVersion: app/v1
           Kind; DaemonSet
           metadata:
              name: anything
              labels:
                 K8s-app: fluented-logging
           spec: 
              selector:
                  matchLabels:
                       name: fluent-elasticsearch
                  template:
                     metadata:
                       labels:
                         name:  fluent-elasticsearch                        
            spec:
               containers:
                 - name:  fluent-elasticsearch
                   image: nginx  
-To execute it RUN <kubectl appyl -f daemonset.yaml>  
               RUN <kubectl get pod>  or k get pod -o wide
               RUN <kubectl get daemonset>
