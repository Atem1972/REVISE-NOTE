TAke note,
  if u can not fine the value of this command ie connect-to-cluster = aws eks update-kubeconfig --rgion us-east-1 --name utrains-eks-7jwqem    ,, what 
  u simply need to do is copy the content of that file manuall then locate where ~/.kube/config is vi to it and past the content of ur cluster in there 

  NB WE DO NOT DEPLOY DATABASE IN THE CLUSTER  BUT THE DATABASE INFORMATION CAN BE KEPT IN THE CLUSETR LIKE USERNAME, ETC
