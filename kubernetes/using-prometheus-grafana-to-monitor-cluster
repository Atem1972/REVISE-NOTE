before the below make sure u are using but helm to deploy ur cluster


##  MOMITORING THE CLUSTER
 # lets add a monitoring tool in our cluster call prometheus
  - go to ur browser type helm.sh
  - click on chart
  - on the serch package write prometheus
  - look for official
  - click on the prometheus log and open it
  - look for get repository info, copy what is under it take to u vsc and install it , not on cluster, make sure is prometheus and grafana together

 ## befor we install helm ,lets first create a namespace so that we can install it in a specific namespace
  RUN <kubectl create ns monitoring>  ## this will create namespace
  RUN <helm install (put the name u want it to be called here )-n monitoring prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack>  ## this will install prometheus and grafana  -n represent namespace,
  RUN <kubectl get all -n monitoring>  ## this will u everything under this namespace
  To edit prometheus and grafana service type RUN <kubectl edit service/prometheus-grafana -n monitoring>  # look for type change to loadBalancer
  to check if it was change RUN <kubectl get all -n monitoring> ## copy the LB URL AND GO ON THE BROWSER
  TO UNSTALL RUN <helm uninstall prometheus -n monitoring>

  # HOW to login to the grafana
  - RUN <kubectl get secret -n monitoring>
  - RUN <kubectl describe secret prometheus-grafana -n monitoring>
  - RUN <kubectl edit secret prometheus-grafana -n monitoring>   ### here u will see the admin passwd and admin user copy it go to the termina an decrypt 
  - RUN <echo (past the admin passwd u copy here) |base64 -d >   ## this will decode it and show u the original passwd
  - RUN AGAIN <echo (past the admin username u copy here) |base64 -d >        ## this will decode it and show u the original username

  # Lets navigate through the grafana webpage
  - click on the hamburg on the left
  - click on dashboard, then new on the right then import   ## the id is 3119
  - click on what u want to see ie pod, node etc and it will display it and from there u can start moniyoring the cluster











                                        




                          ##app1 is the name, we can put any name
                            this is done in vsc not on linux sever
