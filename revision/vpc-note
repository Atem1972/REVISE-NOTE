vpc is what protect our infrastructure in the cloud
every vpc has a name
all vpc has a ciDRS ie 192.168.0.0/16 this will give 65k ip address
meaning of cidrs = classless inter domain routing
for trafic from the internet to get to my vpc we need to creat internet gate way. with it my vpc is in the private mode
when will have internet gate way created trafic from internet can flow to only infrastructed that are on public network it can not get to 
    any infrastructure under private network. this means we only put infrastructure on ppublic subnet if they need to access the internet
We need a rout table to help us rout the internet on our infrastructure ie how trafic will route to both infrastructure on public and private
VPC ARE PER REGION  (region is the geographical location) north virginal us-east-1
AND SUBNET ARE PER AVALIABILITY ZONE (AZ)  here is the physical data center .we have 6 azOR building in north virginal ie
   BUILDIND1 US-EAST-1A   BUILDING2 US-EAST-1B BUILDING3 US-EAST-1C  BUILDING4 US-EAST-1D ......


WE CAN use nat gateway on the publice subnet which can use download from the internet
