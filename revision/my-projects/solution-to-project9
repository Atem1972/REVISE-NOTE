## AWS PROJECT 9: List S3 Buckets that have public access using Lambda Function
 

Problem Statement:
 

At work, there is an ongoing need to identify and monitor all S3 buckets with public access. Public access to S3 buckets poses a significant risk to the security and confidentiality of company data. Addressing this issue is crucial to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential compromises.
# we can make the python code to allow some bucket that are public
 
Solution Approaches:
 

There are two main ways to address this problem:

# On-Premise Solution:
Write a Python script using Boto3 to list all S3 buckets with public access.
Send an email notification to the security team.
Schedule the script using a cron job on a Linux machine.

# Cloud-Based Solution:
Write a Python script using Boto3 to list all S3 buckets with public access.
Send an email notification to the security team.
Use an AWS Lambda function as the runtime for the script.
Schedule the Lambda function using a CloudWatch event. ie we we go to cloudwatch create an event that will trigger our code in lamda to run at our agree time



small project write a python script to start instance at 7 am and another to to stop instance at 7pm 
- use conjob if uare on premise and lambda + cloudwatch event if u are on cloud and create and sns notfiction service to inform u if he did it
- write a python code to delete instances that do not have tag on it
- scheldule backup of instance using lambda function , we will nd pythond code
- scheldule database backup using lambda
- scheldule transfer of AMI from one region to another 

 
## Chosen Solution:

# go to SES IN aws to create email
- click on create identity
- click on email address
- emaill address = put ur email
- click create
- go to ur email an confirm

# create a lambda function
- go to aws, click on create lambdafunction
- choose the code language
- create
- copy and past the script in the lambda function
- on the code modify it with the email u created in SES
- PLEASE LOOk for sensitive data create an enviroment variable from lambda environment and only call on the python code

# our lambda need to talk to SES AND S3 let create a role and attach policy
- go to aws iam click on creat role
- select ec2
- select lambda
- other permision police = amazonsesfullaceess and amazons3fulaccess or read only
- click on add permision

# lets test our lambda function
- go to test
- event name = any name 
- save and click on test
- if u get and error message of time out then
- go to configuration/ general


# lets set it to run every monday of the week this will  trigger automatically using cloudwatch
- go to aws and click on cloudwatch
- click rules create rules
- name = any name
- click scheldule
- click continus to crate rule
- on cron = 00 8 ? * mon *
- next
- click on the drop down a choose lambda
- select the name of the function u want to trigger
- click create rule
