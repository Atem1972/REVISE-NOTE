# Network Hardening Using Amazon Inspector and AWS Systems Manager
 

# Lab overview
Securing an infrastructure can be a challenge for any company. Companies use many tools to audit networks and find vulnerabilities in systems and applications. This process takes significant time and effort.

In this lab, you are a new security engineer for AnyCompany. You need to identify weak areas in the company's network security and update AnyCompany's environment for better efficiency and optimization. You will use Amazon Inspector to do this.

Amazon Inspector runs scans that analyze all your network configurations—such as security groups, network access control lists (network ACLs), route tables, and internet gateways—together to infer reachability. You don't need to send packets across the virtual private cloud (VPC) network or connect to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance network ports. It’s like packetless network mapping and reconnaissance.

From Amazon Inspector, you will use the network reachability package to analyze your network configurations to find security vulnerabilities in your EC2 instances. The findings that Amazon Inspector generates also provide guidance about restricting access that is not secure.

# Objectives
After completing this lab, you should be able to:

Configure Amazon Inspector
Run an agentless network audit
Investigate the scan results
Update security groups
Log in to an application server instance using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager

# Lab environment

The current environment has two EC2 instances. One instance is a bastion server named BastionServer in a public subnet. The other instance is an application server named AppServer in a private subnet.

Bastion servers are servers used to manage access to an internal or private network from an external network. They are sometimes called jump boxes or jump servers. Because bastion servers are often accessible from the internet, they typically run a minimum number of services to reduce their attack surface. They are also commonly used to proxy and log communications, such as Secure Shell (SSH) sessions.

All backend components, such as Amazon EC2, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles, and some Amazon Web Services (AWS) services, have been built into your lab already.

 




# Task 1: View EC2 instances and add tags
To create an assessment target for Amazon Inspector Classic to assess, you start by tagging the EC2 instances that you want to include in your target. In this task, you tag the BastionServer instance.

Every AWS tag consists of a key and value pair of your choice. For example, you might choose to name your key Name and your value MyFirstInstance.

In the AWS Management Console, choose Services  and select EC2.

If you see New EC2 Experience at the upper-left of your screen, confirm that  New EC2 Experience is selected. This lab is designed to use the new Amazon EC2 console.

In the left navigation pane, choose Instances.

The running BastionServer and AppServer EC2 instances are listed.

Choose the BastionServer instance.

Choose the Tags tab.

Choose Manage tags.

Choose Add tag, and then enter the following information:

Key: SecurityScan
Value: true
Choose Save.
# Summary of Task 1
You have successfully applied tags for the BastionServer instance, which allows the security scan to find and scan this instance.

 

# Task 2: Configure and run Amazon Inspector
In this task, you learn how to run an agentless network audit on your EC2 instances using Amazon Inspector. For this lab, you use the network reachability rules package.

Use case: It might not be possible to install agents on all hosts in your deployment. Not all types of operating systems support Amazon Inspector agents. Using this method, you will be able to run network audit on all hosts.

In the AWS Management Console, choose then Services menu. Then choose Security, Identity, & Compliance and choose Inspector.

To open the navigation pane, choose  on the left.

Choose Switch to Inspector Classic 

Choose Get started.

Choose Advanced setup.

In the Define an assessment target section, configure the following options:

For Name, enter Network-Audit
Clear the check box for All Instances.
For Tags: Key, choose SecurityScan.
For Tags: Value, choose true.
Clear the check box for Install Agents.
Choose Next.

In the Define an assessment template section, configure the following options:

For Name, enter Assessment-Template-Network
For Rules packages, leave Network Reachability-1.1 selected, but choose the  next to each of the other packages to remove them.
For Duration, choose 15 Minutes.
Clear the check box for Assessment Schedule.
Choose Next.

Choose Create.

You should see a SUCCESS notification, which confirms that the assessment run was initiated. It takes about 3-5 minutes to complete. While you wait, learn more about Amazon Inspector.

Check the status of the scan:

In the left navigation pane, choose Assessment runs.
In the Amazon Inspector - Assessment Runs section, choose the  in the row for the run that you initiated to expand it and access more options for your run.
To see the status of the run, choose Show status. If you do not see Show status, choose  at the top.
To close and return to the previous screen, choose Close.
Once the status changes to Analysis complete, choose Findings in the left navigation pane.
Summary of Task 2
In this task, you created an assessment target (a collection of the AWS resources that you want Amazon Inspector Classic to analyze). Then you created an assessment template (a blueprint that you use to configure your assessment). You used the template to start an assessment run, which is the monitoring and analysis process that results in a set of findings.

 

# Task 3: Analyze Amazon Inspector findings
The findings that these rules generate show whether your ports are reachable from the internet through an internet gateway (including instances behind Application Load Balancers or Classic Load Balancers), a VPC peering connection, or a virtual private network (VPN) through a virtual gateway. These findings also highlight network configurations that allow for potentially malicious access, such as mismanaged security groups, ACLs, and internet gateways.

Choose  to expand the high-severity finding. You should see the following key details:

AWS agent ID shows you the affected EC2 instance.
Description shows the reason for the finding. In this case, TCP port 23, which is associated with Telnet, is reachable from the internet.
Recommendation provides remediation suggestions.
 Telnet is a text-based terminal emulation utility that is part of the TCP/IP suite of protocols. It allows a system to connect to a remote host to perform commands as if you were on the console of the remote machine.

Choose  to expand the medium-severity findings and analyze the details.

For the medium-severity finding, TCP port 22, which is associated with SSH, is reachable from the internet.
 SSH, like the Telnet utility, gives a user the ability to log in to a remote machine and perform commands as if they were on the console of that system. Telnet, however, is insecure because its data isn't encrypted when communicated. SSH provides a secure, encrypted tunnel to access another system remotely.

 

# Task 4: Update security groups
In this task, you see a few remediation options for the security findings that Amazon Inspector discovered. The first option shows how to lock down port 22 to specific IP addresses.

Choose  to expand the details of the high-severity finding.
In the Recommendation section, choose the link to the security group. The link should look similar to the following example: sg-0b2dc685cd6e6e706. When the link opens, you can see the BastionServerSG security group that is attached to the BastionServer that has produced findings within Amazon Inspector.
Choose the Inbound rules tab. These are the current inbound rules for this security group. They are also the high and medium findings that Amazon Inspector caught.
Choose Edit inbound rules.
For the inbound rule associated with port range 23, choose Delete.  Port 23 Telnet is vulnerable to security attacks, and the SSH protocol helps you to overcome many security issues of Telnet. SSH is now the only major protocol to access the network devices and servers over the internet.
For the SSH rule, remove the current inbound IP address of 0.0.0.0/0 by choosing the X next to it to update the resource. The 0.0.0.0/0 IP address for inbound rules means that port 22 is accessible from anyone on the internet. You can adjust the inbound rules so that only your IP address is able to access port 22. Although this option is much more secure, it still has vulnerabilities. For example, someone could access the computer that is associated with that IP address and gain access.
For Source, choose the Custom dropdown list, and then select My IP.
Choose Save rules.
Re-scan the environment
Navigate to the browser tab that has Amazon Inspector open. In the left navigation pane, choose Assessment templates.

Select the check box next to Assessment-Template-Network, and choose Run.

This step runs the same scan from earlier in the lab and produces findings from the security group updates. Note The scan takes approximately 30-60 seconds to complete.

In the left navigation pane, choose Assessment runs, and refresh every 10-15 seconds until the Status changes to Analysis complete.
In the left navigation pane, choose Findings, and then choose Date to sort by most-recent findings. The high-severity finding is now gone, but the medium-severity finding remains. Although port 22 was scoped down to allow access to only your IP address, port 22 is still technically open to the internet outside the VPC.
Summary of Task 4
In this task, you updated the security group attached to the BastionServer so that it allows traffic from only your IP address instead of the open internet and removed the wide-open and no-longer-needed Telnet port.

 

# Task 5: Replace BastionServer with Systems Manager
In this task, you replace the BastionServer instance, which has primarily used SSH to connect to the AppServer within the private subnet. Instead, you use Session Manager via Systems Manager.

Systems Manager is a secure end-to-end management solution for hybrid cloud environments. Systems Manager is the operations hub for your AWS applications and resources and consists of four core feature groups.

In the AWS Management Console, choose Services  and select EC2.

In the left navigation pane, choose Security Groups.

Choose the Security group ID for BastionServerSG.

Choose Edit inbound rules.

Choose Delete, and then choose Save rules to remove the SSH inbound rule.

In the left navigation pane, choose Instances.

Select the check box for BastionServer. Then choose the Instance state  dropdown list, and choose Stop instance.

In the confirmation dialog, choose Stop.

Next, connect to the AppServer directly using Session Manager.

With Session Manager, you can quickly and securely access your EC2 instances through an interactive one-click browser-based shell or through the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.

Select the check box next to AppServer, and then choose Connect. You are now connected directly to the AppServer.
Enter in the following Linux commands to change the directory and to view the current working directory of the AppServer.

cd ~
pwd
The output should look like the following: /home/ssm-user

# Final scan of the environment
Go to your browser tab that has Amazon Inspector open.
In the left navigation pane, choose Assessment runs.
Select the check box for the previously run assessment, and then choose Run.
Wait for the Status to show Analysis complete, and choose  to expand the details of the most recent assessment run.
Verify that there are zero Findings.
Summary of Task 5
You have successfully improved the network security by adding an IAM role to the AppServer and removing the SSH inbound rule within the Bastion security group while making it even easier to connect using Session Manager provided by Systems Manager.

 

# Conclusion
 Congratulations! You now have successfully:

Configured Amazon Inspector
Run an agentless network audit
Investigated the scan results
Updated security groups
Logged in to an application server using Session Manager














Systems Hardening with Patch Manager via AWS Systems Manager
 

Lab overview
In organizations with hundreds and often thousands of workstations, it can be logistically challenging to keep all the operating system (OS) and application software up to date. In most cases, OS updates on workstations can be automatically applied via the network. However, administrators must have a clear security policy and baseline plan to ensure that all workstations are running a certain minimum version of software.

In this lab, you use Patch Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, to create a patch baseline. You then use the patch baseline that you created to scan the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances for Windows that were pre-created for this lab. You also use default patch baseline to patch EC2 Linux instances.

 

Objectives
After completing this lab, you should be able to:

Patch Linux instances using default baseline

Create custom patch baseline

Use patch groups to to patch Windows instances using custom patch baseline

Verify patch compliance

Duration
This lab requires approximately 60 minutes to complete.

Lab environment
The current environment has six EC2 instances: three instances with the Linux OS and three with the Windows OS.

All backend components, such as EC2 instances, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles, and some AWS services, have been built into your lab already.

 

Accessing the AWS Management Console
At the upper-right corner of these instructions, choose  Start Lab

Troubleshooting tip: If you get an Access Denied error, close the error box, and choose  Start Lab again.

The following information indicates the lab status:

A red circle next to AWS  at the upper-left corner of this page indicates that the lab has not been started.

A yellow circle next to AWS  at the upper-left corner of this page indicates that the lab is starting.

A green circle next to AWS  at the upper-left corner of this page indicates that the lab is ready.

Wait for the lab to be ready before proceeding.

At the top of these instructions, choose the green circle next to AWS 

This option opens the AWS Management Console in a new browser tab. The system automatically sign you in.

Tip: If a new browser tab does not open, a banner or icon at the top of your browser might indicate that your browser is preventing the site from opening pop-up windows. Choose the banner or icon, and choose Allow pop-ups.

If you see a dialog prompting you to switch to the new console home, choose Switch to the new Console Home.

Arrange the AWS Management Console tab so that it displays along side these instructions. Ideally, you should be able to see both browser tabs at the same time so that you can follow the lab steps.

 Do not change the lab Region unless specifically instructed to do so.


Task 1: Patch Linux instances using default baselines
In this task, you patch Linux EC2 instances using default baselines available for the OS.

Patch Manager provides predefined patch baselines for each of the operating systems that it supports. You can use these baselines as they are currently configured (you can't customize them), or you can create your own custom patch baselines. You can use custom patch baselines for greater control over which patches are approved or rejected for your environment.

In the AWS Management Console, in the search  box, enter Systems Manager and select it. This option takes you to the Systems Manager console page.

In the left navigation pane, under Node Management, choose Fleet Manager. Here are the pre-configured EC2 instances. There are three Linux instances and three Windows instances. These EC2 instances have a specific IAM role associated with them that allows you you managed them using Systems Manager, which is why you can view them in the Fleet Manager section. This is also part of the lab setup.

Select the check box next to Linux-1. Then choose the Node actions  dropdown list, and choose View details. Here you can view details about the specific instance, such as Platform type, Node type, OS name, and the IAM role that allows you to use Systems Manager to manage this instance.

At the top of the page, choose AWS Systems Manager to go back to the Systems Manager homepage.

In the left navigation pane, under Node Management, choose Patch Manager.

Choose Start with an overview (Proceed to next step if this option does not appear).

Choose Patch now to patch the Linux instances with AWS-AmazonLinux2DefaultPatchBaseline.

Under Basic configuration, configure as follows:

Patching operation: Scan and install

Reboot option: Reboot if needed

Instances to patch: Patch only the target instances I specify

Target selection: Specify instance tags

Tag key: Patch Group

Tag value: LinuxProd

Choose Add

Choose Patch now

Observe the status of the patching.

A new page displays. In the AWS-PatchNowAssociation panel, there is a Status field that will show that three instances will be affected and the progress made.

A Scan/Install operation summary panel also displays the status of the affected EC2 instances visually. Monitor this page until the patch operation on all three instances completes.

Task 2: Create a custom patch baseline for Windows instances
In this task, you create a custom patch baseline for the Windows instances. Although Windows has default patch baselines that you can use, for this use case, you set up a baseline for Windows security updates.

Return to the Systems Manager console. In the search bar at the top, enter Systems Manager and then select it.

In the left navigation pane, under Node Management, choose Patch Manager.

Choose Start with an overview (Proceed to next step if this option does not appear).

Choose the Patch baselines tab.

Choose the Create patch baseline button.

For Patch baseline details, configure the following options:

For Name, enter WindowsServerSecurityUpdates

For Description - optional, enter Windows security baseline patch

For Operating system, choose Windows.

Leave the check box for Default patch baseline unselected.

In the Approval rules for operating systems section, configure the following options:

Products: From the dropdown list, choose WindowsServer2019. Also, deselect All so that it no longer appears under Products.

Severity: This option indicates the severity value of the patches that the rule applies to. To ensure that all service packs are included by the rule, choose Critical from the dropdown list.

Classification: From the dropdown list, choose SecurityUpdates.

Auto-approval: Enter 3 days.

Compliance reporting - optional: From the dropdown list, choose Critical.

Choose Add rule to add a second rule to this patch baseline, and configure the following options:

Products: From the dropdown list, choose WindowsServer2019. Also, deselect All so that it no longer appears under Products.

Severity: From the dropdown list, choose Important.

Classification: From the dropdown list, choose SecurityUpdates.

Auto-approval: Enter 3 days.

Compliance reporting - optional: From the dropdown list, choose High.

Choose Create patch baseline.

Next, modify a patch group for the Windows patch baseline that you just created, to associate it with a patch group.

In the Patch baselines section, select the button for the WindowsServerSecurityUpdates patch baseline that you just created. Note: The patch baseline that you created may be on the second page of the baselines list. You could also use the search bar to locate it and then select it.

Choose the Actions dropdown list, and then choose Modify patch groups.

In the Modify patch groups section under Patch groups, enter WindowsProd

Choose the Add button, and then choose Close.

 

Task 3: Patching the Windows instances
In this task, you patch the Windows instances using the Patch now feature based on the tag associated with them.

After configuration, Patch Manager uses the Run Command to call the RunPatchBaseline document to evaluate which patches should be installed on target instances according to each instance's operating system type directly or during the defined schedule (maintenance window).

Task 3.1: Tagging Windows instances
In this task, you tag your Windows instances. Later in the lab, you create a patch group and associate it with these tags.

 The Linux instances were pre-configured during lab setup with LinuxProd tags and do not need any added tags.

In the AWS Management Console, in the search  bar, enter EC2 and select it.

Choose Instances, select the check box next to the Windows-1 instance, and then choose the Tags tab.

Choose the Manage tags button, choose Add new tag, and configure the following options:

Key: Enter Patch Group

Value: Enter WindowsProd

Choose Save.

Repeat the previous steps to tag the Windows-2 and Windows-3 instances with the same tag.

Task 3.2: Patching Windows instances
Return to the Systems Manager console. In the search bar at the top, enter Systems Manager and then select it.

To Patch the Windows instances:

Choose Patch Manager

Choose Start with an overview (Proceed to next step if this option does not appear).

Choose Patch now.

Patching operation: Scan and install

Reboot option: Reboot if needed

Instances to patch: Patch only the target instances I specify

Target selection: Specify instance tags

Tag key: Patch Group

Tag value: WindowsProd

Choose Add

Choose Patch now

A new page displays. When it becomes available, choose the link to the Execution ID.

A page in the State Manager part of Systems Manager opens.

Choose the Output link for one of the managed instances that shows a status of InProgress.

A page in the Run Command part of Systems Manager opens.

Expand the Output panel to observe the details.

 Behind the scenes, Patch Manager uses the Run Command to run the PatchBaselineOperations. If you scroll through the output, you should see the PatchGroup: WindowsProd details.

A Systems Manager document (SSM document) defines the actions that Systems Manager performs on your managed instances.

 

Task 4: Verifying compliance
In the left navigation pane, under Node Management, choose Patch Manager.

Choose the Dashboard tab. Under Compliance summary, you should now see Compliant: 6, which verifies that all Windows and Linux instances are compliant.

Choose the Compliance reporting tab.  This tab provides an overview of all running instances with SSM. You should be able to verify that the Compliance status of all Linux and Windows instances is Compliant.

All six instance (three Linux and three Windows) should show as compliant.

Scroll to the right in the Node patching details panel to find for each instance:

Critical noncompliant count

Security noncompliant count

Other noncompliant count

Last operation date

Baseline ID

Choose the Node ID for one of the Windows nodes.

In the Node ID page that opens, choose the Patch tab.

Scroll down and observe what patches were applied to this instance, as well as the Installed Time.
