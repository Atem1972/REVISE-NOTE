  source_id = aws_instance.ec2_instance.id  # this simply means create ami from this instance , this a part to our instance
  ami_name = "jenkins_ami"                  # this is simply the name u want to call ur ami
}

output "jenkins_ami_id" {

}

run terraform init
terraform apply
- go to aws and check if it was created
- go to ec2, scrowdown to amis , u will see it


## please make sure before u destroy the entire infrastructure detach the AMI from the entire infrastructure so that it will not be destroy with others ie
  - firsrtly comment the resource as seen bellow;
  
  /* #like this
  module "ami" {
    source = "../ami-creation"                
    source_id = aws_instance.ec2_instance.id  
    ami_name = "jenkins_ami"                  
  }
  
  output "jenkins_ami_id" {
    value = module.ami.ami_id
  }
    */ like this

 run terraform state list                                     ##this will show u everything terraform created
 run terraform state rm module.ami.aws_ami_from_instance.ami  ##  this is to remove a particular resource u donot want terraform to track again

## you can now destroy ur infrastructure
terraform destroy --auto-approve
