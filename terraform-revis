CHECK EXPLANATION OF CICD ON W12D4

## note AMI are region specific, that means each region has diffn ami eg ohio, north virgina,etc
## note how to limit people from creating many ssh keys just to make changes on our instance in aws,? we use ci tool call JENKINS
 our statefile is store in s3 AND LOCK WITH DYNAMODB SO THAT ONLY ONE PERSON CAN WORK ON IT AT A TIME , THIS HELP TO PREVENT DAMAGE ON OUR STATEFILE

# how to edit terraform resource name

terraform state list
terraform state move aws_iam_user.user1 aws_iam_user.user2


# how to destroy only one resource bloock in terraform
- we can command it out with # and do apply  or 
- run terraform state list
- run terraform destroy --target then the resource u want to destroy


# how to do terraform graph


provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"

}

resource "aws_vpc" "vpc1" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  instance_tenancy = "default"
}

resource "aws_subnet" "sb1" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.vpc1.id
}

run terraform graph >file.dot
dot -Tpng file.dot -o graph.png


A)how to prevent resource from being delete mistakenly? we use life cycle metargument
b)how to tell terraform to create new resource befor distroying the old one?  we use life cycle metargument
u can get this on metargument file google more life cycle 

## check for this metargument call provider 
       provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
  alias = "us1"
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-2"
  alias = "us1"
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-1"
  alias = "us3"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  provider = aws.us1
  instance_type = t2_micro
  ami = ami-09099
  
}
