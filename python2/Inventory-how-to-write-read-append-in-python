# file-handeling.py
# we use this to open files in python and edit it ie 'w','r',append and many more

f = open('filename','w')   # 'w','r','a'  # 'wt',wb


f.close()
## that above is how u should start with ur file opening and end with close



                      OR




## writing text to a file
 with open('text.txt', 'w') as f:   # this will creat a file call text.txt     # becarefull when u use 'w' bc if u want toadd 
                                     # content on ur file it will over write other text in it 
        f.read()                    # this when u just want to read in the file text.txt
        f.write("hello world")      # this will write this text to the file above text.txt 
execute it        




## appending text to a file
 with open('text.txt', 'a') as f:   # this will creat a file call text.txt   ## the 'a' will append ur new text to e file
                                     
        f.read()                    # this when u just want to read in the file text.txt
        f.write("\nhello ojong\n")      # this will write this text to the file above text.txt 
execute it 




## read text in a file
 with open('text.txt', 'r') as f:   # this will creat a file call text.txt     
                                     
        content = f.read()  # or f.readlin() or f.readlins()          # this when u just want to read in the file text.txt
        print(content)
execute it 








# another example
# this will create a spreet shit
import csv    # this is a file

with open('jenkins.csv', 'w',newline='')  as j:      # this will create a jenkins.csv file  # while as j is a variable
        pen = csv.writer(j)
        pen.writerow(["USER_NAME","CELL_PHONE","INSTANCE_TYPE", "REGION"])    #this will create header in e shit 
        pen.writerow(['sserg','4536666','t2-micro','us-east-1'])          # putting valu
Execute it
we can open an see it in file explorer by right click on the file select reveal in file explorer




# project
#### AT work , we haev many jenkins server and there is aneed to inventory stidious task to manually got in jenkins and count the jobs, 
    and the vcs  to each of them . go ahead and propose a solution for this.
  jenkins url: 'http://44.197.324.43:8080'
  jenkins username : 'devops'
  jenkins passsword: 'devops'
all the data should be directed to a jenkins.csv file use .writerow, 




# solution
     import requests
import csv
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

# Jenkins credentials and server URL
JENKINS_URL = 'http://44.197.324.43:8080'
USERNAME = 'devops'
PASSWORD = 'devops'

# Output file
CSV_FILE = 'jenkins.csv'

def get_all_jobs():
    url = f"{JENKINS_URL}/api/json?tree=jobs[name,url]"
    response = requests.get(url, auth=HTTPBasicAuth(USERNAME, PASSWORD))
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json().get('jobs', [])

def get_job_vcs_url(job_url):
    config_url = f"{job_url}config.xml"
    response = requests.get(config_url, auth=HTTPBasicAuth(USERNAME, PASSWORD))
    if response.status_code != 200:
        return "Error fetching config"

    # Parse Git URL (look for <url>...</url> in config XML)
    try:
        import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
        root = ET.fromstring(response.text)
        scm = root.find('.//scm/userRemoteConfigs/hudson.plugins.git.UserRemoteConfig/url')
        return scm.text if scm is not None else "No VCS"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Parse error: {e}"

def main():
    jobs = get_all_jobs()
    print(f"Found {len(jobs)} jobs.")

    with open(CSV_FILE, mode='w', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow(['Job Name', 'Job URL', 'VCS URL'])

        for job in jobs:
            job_name = job['name']
            job_url = job['url']

            writer.writerow([job_name, job_url, vcs_url])
            print(f"Logged: {job_name} - {vcs_url}")

if __name__ == '__main__':      ### this line of code simply means from line 110 to 123  can only be execute if i do it here
