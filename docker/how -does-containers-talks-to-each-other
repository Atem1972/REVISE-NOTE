containers can talk to each other if they are in the network as seen bellow



# what is network in docker?  it helps us to isolate containers in specific networks
- run docker network ls  = to least all the network
  bridge network::   means it is connected to our local host
  host network :   means a network that is just share by docker
  none network : means it can not talk to the internet

- run docker network create net  = to create a network 
- run  docker network ls = to list all the network
- run docker run -d --rm --network net -e MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=abc123 -e MARIADB_DATABASE=webserver -e MARIADB_USER=oracle -e MARIADB_PASSWORD=abc123 --name mariadb         mariadb:latest  # this will run u a mariadb container, the -e are creating environment variable in the container
- run docker ps
- docker exec mariadb env  = to check the environment variable
- docker run -d --rm --name wordpress1 -p 80:80 --network net  -e WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=mariadb -e WORDPRESS_DB_USER=oracle -e WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=abc123 -e WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=webserver wordpress  # this will bring up a wordpress container that has been link to our database
-run docker ps = to least all the container runing
- take the ip addres of ur server plus port number to the broswer to see wordpress ie 2.2.2.2:80
