# any experience with bash shell script? yes
 i wrote a script to delete logs, basicaly an application was generating so much logs and each time the logs will full the hard drive and this will generate 
 alert and some body will need to ssh to the server and do away with the logs . we had a meeting and i ask the team involve a long is the logs soppose to be 
 there before they do away with it , they said 10 days at most so i wrote a bash shell script that can do a way with the logs scheldule it using cronjob
