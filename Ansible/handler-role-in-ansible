# what is the meaning of dry code?  Dont repeat urself
what is role in ansible? it is just away to write a real usable playbook ie somebody just need to fit value on ur playbook to do samee thing

lets write a playbook called play6.yml
 ---
   - host: webserver
        become: true
        tasks:
#            - name: update all packages
            package or yum:
              name: '*'   ### means update all packages
              state: latest

#          - name:  install apache
              yum:
              name: httpd
              state: present

#          - name:   Start httpd daemon
              service:
              name: httpd
              state: started
              enabled: true

#          - name: CREATE a file
              file:
              dest: /var/www/html/index.html
              state: touch

#          - name:  to add content in a file on the target server    
             lineinfile:
             path: /var/www/html/index.html
             line: <h1>  this apache webserver was build using ansible </h1>       ## this message will appear on our apache broswer
              
#          - name: Restart a Daemon
             servic:
              name: httpd
              state: restarted
              notify: restart daemond    ## this will notify the handler to always triger the daemon to start when we reboot it

#       handlers:     ## this will triger the restart of the above daemon anytime we reboot it
            - name: restart daemond
             service: 
             name: httpd
             state: restarted




# execute the playbook      Run  ansible-playbook play6.yml --syntax-check   ## to check sytax
#                           run yamllint play6.ylm                           ## to check syntax
#                           RUN ansible-playbook play6.yml      ## to execute playbook                        






##  ####     Now lets create roles  , this role is a way to write an ansible playbook and some called the role fit his own value he do need to 
  write the entired playbook ######

-    create a folder called roles
##    we need to tell ansible where to get the role task
   - go to your ansible.cfg and write the following
           roles_path = /home/ec2-user/ansible-dev/roles     ## this is simply telling ansible that if i call a role go to this path and check it
    - lets cd to the roles we created above
    - run ansible init apache     ## this comman is to create the role and the name of the role will be call apache
    - lets create another role  ansible init urld
    - run ls  , u will see that the is a folder created for all the role we created above
    - cd to the apache folder , u will see many other sub folder
#       on meta folder open the main.yml file  ## this file carries information about owner of the role u can edit it put ur own information
#       on handler forlder is where we put our handler eg
            
            --- 
              - name: restart daemond
             service: 
             name: httpd
             state: restarted

#        on file folder, if you want to copy a file to a target forlder u can write the task here  eg
               ---
#        on the default forlder we can put variable in it    

#        on tasks folder is where we define our task eg
            ---
              - name: installing apache 
              yum:                             ## all the bellow variable are this that can change
              name: "{{apache_package}}"    # #u can fine or writte the content here in th var forld
              state: "{{pkg_state}}"         # #u can fine or writte the content here in th var forld 

           - name:  starting daemond
           service:
           name:  "{{service_name}}"      # #u can fine or writte the content here in th var forld 
           state: "{{service_state}}"       # #u can fine or writte the content here in th var forld 

            - name: CREATE a file
              file:
              path: "{{file_path}}"     # #u can fine or writte the content here in th var forld
              state: "{{file_state}}"   # #u can fine or writte the content here in th var forld

           - name: file content
           lineinfile:
           path: "{{file_path}}"    # #u can fine or writte the content here in th var forlder
           line: "{{content}}"      # #u can fine or writte the content here in th var forld

#     on the var folder lets put all the variable value since we are calling the value in tasks folder
                ---   
                apache_package: hettpd
                pkg_state: present
                service_name: httpd
                service_state: started
                file_path: /var/www/html/index.html
                file_state: touch
                ontent: '<h1> jhfdjf fjhdf jfhj</h1>


### how to call the above role ie calling some other person playbook and u only need to fit ur own value  without writing the entire playbook
   - create folder called ansible-dev cd to it
   -  vi test.yml
           ---
           - hosts:
           become: true 
           roles:                     ## here now is normall tasks as we use to use but role
            - apache                ## this is the name of the role we created above , this name canbe change depending on the name u call ur role
            - java
            - nginx
            - urld

 TO execute it run ansible-playbook test.yml
