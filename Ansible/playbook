- how to check if our playbook is well written, RUN ansible-playbook playbk.yml --syntax-check   # the --syntax-check is like testing unit test in jenkin 
- how to execute our playbook, RUN ansible-playbook playbk.yml

### how to limit a playbook inventory.yml to run only on a particular servers and not the entire host
on the terminal run ansible-playbook playbk.yml -l 334.43.34.53    # this means run this playbook only on the instance with this ip address






## Second playbook
 vi play2.yml

   - hosts: webserver
   become: = true
   ignore_errors: = yes
   gather_facts: yes
   vars:          ## this how to declear a variable in ansible
    package_name: httpd
       

#   tasks:
#        - name:  install package
        yum:                                    ## module, you can go to chatgpt and ask what module can i use to install packaage and their agument
        name: "{{package_name}}"           ## calling variable in ansible     
        state: present

#       - name: create groups              ## this task can be use when u want to create many groups at onces
          group:
          state: presnt
          name: "{{items}}"
          loop:
           - cloud
           - security
           - devops
           - linuxad
              


- To check syntax of the playbook Run ansible-playbook play2.yml --syntax-check or just --check  
- To execute the playbook Run   ansible-playbook play2.yml

                                        what it actualy run. u can use the below line 141-143 to display it   
#         - name: display the output variable
           debug:
           var: uptime_output.stdout_line       ## this simply mean go to the task in line 137 check the output in <register:>
                                               and display it here for me . # take note the .stdout_line is and attach way to get just exact something
