- how to check if our playbook is well written, RUN ansible-playbook playbk.yml --syntax-check   # the --syntax-check is like testing unit test in jenkin 
- how to execute our playbook, RUN ansible-playbook playbk.yml

### how to limit a playbook inventory.yml to run only on a particular servers and not the entire host
on the terminal run ansible-playbook playbk.yml -l 334.43.34.53    # this means run this playbook only on the instance with this ip address

                                        what it actualy run. u can use the below line 141-143 to display it

           debug:

                                               and display it here for me . # take note the .stdout_line is and attach way to get just exact something




- To check syntax of the playbook Run ansible-playbook play2.yml --syntax-check or just --check  
- To execute the playbook Run   ansible-playbook play2.yml 

## how to assign ansible to run only a specific task in the inventory.yml file
we can do this by using the agument tags:
- To execute that <Run ansible-playbook play3.yml -- tags:package, debug>  # this will run only the task with this tag
                                                                         

## how to encript sensible file or data in ansible
- run  ansible-vault encrypt inventory.yml  press enter ## in the space of inventory.yml u can put any file there that u wise to encrypt
  new vault password: put anything u can remember
  confirm new vault password: repeat the password above here 
- to edit the encrypted inventory.yml Run ansible-vault edit inventory.yml
        vault password: put the password u created above

## how to change the encrypted file password?
 Run ansible-vault rekey inventory.yml
   vault password: put the old passwd
   new vault passwd: put the new passwd here 

## how to decrypt the passwd u put on ur file
  RUN ansible-vault decrypt inventory.yml

## how to run inventory.yml that has been encrypted
  Run ansible-playbook play1.yml --ask-vault-pass
   vault password: put ur password here

## How to troubleshot error message in ansible
 - after the playbook failed, to know in detail what went wrong run
  RUN ansible-playbook play3.yml -v or -vv or -vvv


# this playbook will go and execute this application on our target server and if we take the ip address and the port number of that 
# target servre we will see our application coming up without us having any direct contact with the instance 

firstly lets create a playbook file call resume.yml
 vi resume.yml
    ---  
    - hosts: webserver
    become: yes
    tasks:
#    - name: installations of packages
     package: or yum:

       - wget
       -httpd

#      -name:   download artifact ie the link to our app

      src:/tmp/main.zip   ## here is like where is the file u want me to unzip

        state: started

run ansible-playbook resume.yml


# how to copy the config file to target machine , ## this is call jinger tamplate 
# We use this module to copy files with dynamic content in it
  - create a file in the working directory of the master node call anything ie apache.j2
            put this below in the file and it was gotten from var.yml

            the url is {URL_link}}
            THE DESTINATION is {{DESt_path}}



       


  -creste a playbook ie template.yml 
        ---
        hosts: all
        gather_fact: no
        vars_files:
         - vars.yml
        tasks:
        - name:  copy config file from master node to destination
        template:
        dest: /tmp/apache.conf     # this will creat this file call apache.conf on the target server and all that will be copy from will be put here
        src: /home/ec2-user/ansible-dev/apache.j2

RUN ansible-playbook template.yml



## how to test my playbook

 - install on the master server run pip3 install yamllink
 - run  yamllink windows.yaml or play3.yml   ## this will tell u small small eroor on ur playbook
