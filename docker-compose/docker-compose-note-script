    SAVE and quite :wq
- run docker-compose up -d  = it will bring up the two containers
- run docker-compose ps   = to least all

 = note it is easy to modify in docker compose if u want to modify only a particular container it will do that without touch the other
  =any changes made on the file  save and run docker compose up -d
  =docker compose can do a defualt network for u but u can create yours as seen above
  always use chtgpt  if u can not generate it
