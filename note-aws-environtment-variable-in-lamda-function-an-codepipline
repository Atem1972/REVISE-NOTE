in aws when a source code is give to u , to build a codepipline check on the buildspec.yml file is the are some sensitive datedata that u can create a variable with . things like aws <account id =3333333, image name =uuu, container name = jjj , repository name =jjj, etc make a veriable from this go to the buildspec instead of putting this sensitive data there instead call them there eg <$account_id, $image name.
on the build stage u can write the real value eg <aws account id =3333333, image name =uuu, container name = jjj , repository name =jjj


same thing with lambda function code 
go to configuration search for variable 
- make varaible out of the sensitive data from ur function code like password = 23343, user_name =gdggg 
- then return to the code and only call the variable like <$password, $user_name



explain this in an interview
python does not use $ to call variable  but this print(user_name) print(passwd)
