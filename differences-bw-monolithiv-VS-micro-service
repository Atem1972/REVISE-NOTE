# monolithic vs micro service

A) monolithic
  - with monolithic everything is in one burg ie all the application is writen in same language , u can not use two diffn language here to write a particular website ie either u use java, python but not both
  - if one of the application is broken the whole application stop functioning ie u can not maintain one of the application without the other
  - if we want to release to production , all most go at once
  - here deploymen is taken place on VMS/MAIN FRAM







  B) micro service
  - here each application isdevelope separate from each other and each application can be writing in diffn language
  - and the application talk to each other using their url and that is called <API CALL>
  - HERE deploymen is on container
  - when frontend application (html) is serving a content to the backend application it is called <REST api>
  - note that when the talk of api is just application talking to each other using their URL EG TERRAFORM TALK TO AWS USING THE API CALL


  # API GATEWAY IN AWS
  - WITH this we only use url and the links of the application ie
    urls/<link> application link
        / <link> application link
        / <link> application link
  - when frontend is talking to lambda function in aws it uses the API GATEWAY SERVICE to create the communication   
  - api gateway help to create the url that are use for two application to talk to each other without the developer developing the communication link
  ie for frontend to any backend application the api gateway will create the link which we are going to use to make the call
