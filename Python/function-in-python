when u see some like in a python called def it simply means it is defining a function
what is function?  it is just a piece of code u can call multiple time
NB instead to say i am writing a python code that will do this and that instead say im writing a function that will do this and that


ex1 how to declare a function and called
  def hello()
      print("hello")   # this is to delclare function 


      # lets called the function above
      hello()              # we are calling the function


 ex2.1
     def display_name(name):   # when will declare function like this (name) is called parameter . when people called this 
     print(f"hello {name}")    # function they are require to fit aguement in the parameter (name)


    # lest called the function above

     display_name('serge')   ## this will take our aguement ('serge') put on the parameter in line 17, and print in line 18 wwill
                                 will consum the value serge


     x=display_name(name)    # for this to work do it as is in ex2.2
     print(x)                #output  will show none bc we can not convert a function to a variable  


 ex2.2
   def display_name(name):
    return f"hello {name}"

x = display_name('serge')
print(x)                    # output hello serge





ex3.1
   def addition(a,b):   
    sum = a + b
    print(sum)  

 # lets called the function above
  addition(2,4)     #output 6

  x=addition(2,4)    # for this to work do it as is in ex3.2
   print(x)         #output  will show none bc we can not convert a function to a variable



 ex3.2  
   def addition(a,b):   
    sum = a + b
    return sum    # with return ,now the value from print can be store in a variable
  x=addition(2,4)
   print(x)       # output 6



ex4
  def command(cmd):
   import os
   os.system(cmd)    

## lets called our function above
command('ls')   #output it will display all files and folder 








### lets share our function to another user to call it and use.
    # he will create a file called anything.py


## this will import all function on the file function-in-python
    import function-in-python  # here will are importing a function from the file called function-in-python
      function-in-python.hello()   ## the function-in-python is the file where our function has been define  while .hello() is the we call our function in ex1
 execute it                                ## output   hello
     

     OR 

## this will import all function on the file function-in-python
 import function-in-python as m     ## this 'as m'  is like alias ie we are making function-in-python to be now m
     m.hello 



## how to import only a paticular function from the many function in the file function-in-python
      import function-in-python as m    ## this 'as m'  is like alias ie we are making function-in-python to be now m
      from function-in-python import hello,command  # this simply means go to the file called function-in-python  import me only the function called hello() and command()

hello()
command('ls')
