b="today"    # this is global variable and it can be print in any function bellow

  def hello()
      print("hello") 
    a= "monday"       # local variable if u print this it will not work bc it is not define



  def display_name(name):   # when will declare function like this (name) is called parameter . when people called this 
     print(f"hello {name}") 
     print(b)   # this will work  global variable
     print(a)    # this will not work be it is declare with another function is call local variable







     ### how to stop someone from calling ur function

     def addition(a,b):
        sum = a+b
        return sum
     def command(cmd):
        import os
        os.system(cmd)

     if __name__=='_main' :   ## with this contructor code ,u just stop someone from calling the function bellow

 my_value = addition1(2,7)    ##  nobody can call this function blc of the  if_name_=='_main_':
     print(my_value)     


                  OR

## WE CAN DO A MODULE FUNCTION FOR IT  ie
     def main()                ### this function can not be call and use in a diffn file but it can  be call here and and use
     my_value = addition1(2,7)  
     print(my_value)
    if_name_=='_main_':   

#lets call the function

 if_name_=='_main_':  
main()
