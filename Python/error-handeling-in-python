when u write a python code at times during execution it will display a fail message  or a user on the browser make a mistake with the url than for us to allow him see the bug of error message we can just put some message that will instaed show, how do we change that message in a single sentence. this will help to avoid bug fail explanation

ex
  try:
  
  except Except as e:    # it means run the code above in A BELLOW if u cash something, BUT if u  dont cash  anything run B
    A
  else:
    B
  finally:   # it means i dont care what happen up there just run me


ex1
print(a)   # if will run this it will fail but how do we make it in such a way that the bug fail message we see beside the user 
              out there shld not see it but to instead a short nice fail message. TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM FROM BELLOW ILLUSTRATION
# add try function on ur code to achieve this

ex1
  try:
      print(a)
 except:   # it means if u cash and error print the bellow , but if the code is without error will not print it
     print("eror occour try again")   


ex2
   try:
     print(a)
  except Except as e:    # it means what ever error message u cash on the above code put it as value for th variabl 'e'
                           
    print(f'Error: {e}')   ## meaning of this line
                        f'Error:  ## it means this will be our new variable and what ever value cash by the 'e' above variable  
                        print it as a value for the Error avariable

   else:  # it just means  if u did not cash any error print the bellow
     print("all good")

   finally:   # it means i dont care what happen up there just run me
    print('print me welther error or no error')


ex3
   print(a)
  except NameError:
    print('Error: wrong code try again')                          
  else:  # it just means  if u did not cash any error print the bellow
     print("all good")
