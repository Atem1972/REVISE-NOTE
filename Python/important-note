in python we have
- module: this is an already writing script u just need to instll , import
    ex
      import jenkins, boto3 etc


##  server = jenkins.jenkins('http:localhost:8080',username='myuser',password='mypasswd')
how to get method associated to this object RUN  <print(dir(server))>


- the server is the <object>:   this is a variable will put to store jenkins crdential to access jenkins 
- jenkins is the module
- .jenkins is the <method>: this are just somethings we can use python to do in jenkins ie like .get_job, .github url, .get_whoami .delete_job etc
method are attach to object


   ex     
      import jenkins
        
    try:
        server =  jenkins.jenkins('http:localhost:8080',username='myuser',password='mypasswd')
        jobs = server.get_all_jobs()
         print(jobs) 
    except:
          print("please double check ur credential or url")    

1) TO know the data type run 
                           print(typejobs)      ## output class list   
2) TO know the total elemen/number of the list run  
                            print(len(jobs))      ## output 23   
3) How tO loop through and print all job store in jobs?
                               server =  jenkins.jenkins('http:localhost:8080',username='myuser',password='mypasswd')
                               jobs = server.get_all_jobs()     
                               for gh in jobs:    # this simply means go to the variable jobs, print each jobs one after another 
                                 print(gh)        # this will print the jobs and put it in gh variable
                                 print('*'*100)      # this will print star 100 time              

4) how to get the value of a key , this means all the key and value that are store in a variable called jobs
 example of this key and value =  fullName: first_job, url:http:localhost:8080',username='myuser',password='mypasswd

                      server =  jenkins.jenkins('http:localhost:8080',username='myuser',password='mypasswd')
                               jobs = server.get_all_jobs()     
                               for gh in jobs:    
                                 print(gh[fullname])
                                 for gh in jobs:
                                  print('*'*100)

5)
  try:
  server =  jenkins.jenkins('http:localhost:8080',username='myuser',password='mypasswd')
  jobs = server.get_all_jobs()
  job_list = []  
  for gh in jobs:
  job_list.append(gh.get('fullname))    # this just means all the jobs names u find in jobs/gh append it to the list call job_list
  print(job_list)   # this will print now all the jobs name appended to job_list 
  print(server.get_job_info('geoapp'))    # this simply mean get me all the inform link to this job name call geoapp in jenkins
  print(serever.get_job_config('geoapp'))
