ALTER TABLE:
 Modifies the structure of an existing table, such as adding or deleting columns, changing data types, or adding constraints. 
DROP DATABASE:
 Deletes an existing database and all its associated tables and data. 
DROP TABLE:
 Deletes a specific table from the database. 
# Data Manipulation Language (DML):
SELECT:
 Retrieves data from one or more tables based on specified criteria.
INSERT:
 Adds new rows (records) into a table.
UPDATE: 
Modifies existing data within a table.
DELETE: 
Removes rows from a table based on specified conditions. 
# Data Control Language (DCL):
GRANT: Grants specific privileges (permissions) to users or roles, allowing them to perform certain actions on the database.
REVOKE: Revokes privileges granted to users or roles. 
# Transaction Control Language (TCL):
COMMIT: Saves all changes made within a transaction permanently.
ROLLBACK: Discards all changes made within a transaction, reverting to the state before the transaction began.
SAVEPOINT: Sets an intermediate point within a transaction, allowing for partial rollback. 
Other Important Commands:
USE: Selects a specific database to work with. 
CREATE VIEW: Creates a virtual table (view) based on the results of a SELECT query.
