lauching a DOCKER LAB

## 1- Clone Terraform code
# Create a new directory, DevOpsLab. Our projects and labs will be created in this directory from here on.
mkdir DevOpsLab

# Navigate to the directory
cd DevOpsLab


# Now create a directory Docker which we will use to create all the Docker labs and projects.
mkdir Docker


# Now move into the directory
cd Docker


# clone the code from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/utrains/docker-Lab.git


# Once the cloning is completed, move into the docker-Lab directory
cd docker-Lab


# At this level, we will explain the code before creating our lab

# 3- Launch Lab
# To launch the lab, run the commands below on your terminal
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply --auto-approve

- ssh to the server

Then copy the SSH command underlined above and paste it to access the server using an SSH connection.
Once in your server, run the command below to verify if your lab is working
- run docker ps
## FINISH LAUNCHING DOCKER LAB

STEP 2
## GO TO AWS AND CREATE ECR REPOSITORY
## PUSH IMAGE YOUR BUILD IMAGE FROM YOUR LAPTOP TO ECR REPOSITORY U CREATED


## DEPLOY THE IMAGE U PUSH TO ECR USING AWS ECS
To deploy to ECS, we need to create a cluster, a task definition, and services.
1- Create a cluster.
Login to your AWS account and on the search bar tap ECS then click on Elastic Container Service 
 
 # HERE CREAT ECS CLUSTER
 - click on create cluster
 - cluster name = any name
 - infrastructure = select aws fargate
 - click create


 - CREAT NEW TASK DEFINATION , U WILL SEE A SPACE TO PUT THE URL OF UR IMAGE IN ECR
   a) task definition = any name
   b)On launch typy, click on aws fargat 
   c) container detail, name = google
   d) url = copy from ecr and past here
   f) essential container = yes
   g) port mapping, <container port= 80,,  <protocol= TCP,,  <PORT NAME= anything http80,,  <app protocol= http
   e) click create task definition

# create service, and service create LB 
 click on cluster
  - click on the name of the cluster u created
  - task definition family = put the name of ur task u created above
  - service name= devservice 
  - On compute option = select capacity provider
  - On capacity provider = select FARGATE
  - On service type = select REPLICA
  - Desire task = 2 and above
  - existing cluster= make sure u select ur cluster name u created earlier  
   - click on LB
   - select application LB
   - container= webapp 80:80
   - application loadbalancer = select create a new LB
   - LB name = anything
   - on listener select = create new listener,  port=80,, protocol= HTTP
   - On target group = select create new target group, target group name= anything,, protocol= HTTP,, deregistration delay= 300,, health check= HTTP,,
                                                             HEALTH CHECK PATH= / 
   - click on creat service
   - check that ur default lb security-group has port 80 open


 - COPY THE LAODBALANCER DNS TO THE BROSWER


 # lets create cicd codepipline
 - go to aws search codepipline
 - click on create codepipline
 - click on Build custom pipeline
 - next
 - Pipeline name = any name
 - next
 # source stag
 - Source provider = click on the drop down and sellect   Github(via Github App)
 - click on connect to github
 - connection name = any name
 - click connect to github
 - click on install new app
 - select and click on ur github name
 - when u are in scrow down and click on all repository
 - click save
 - click on connect
 -  Repository name = select the repo name with ur code 
 - Default branch = main
 - click on codepipline default
  - next

  # codebuild stage
  - click on other build provider
  - select AWS Codebuild

  - click on create project
  - Project name = any name
  - scrow down and click on aditional configuration
  
  - scrow down to Environment variable add the variable bellow
  - AWS_DEFAULT_REGION = us-east-1
  - AWS_ACCOUNT_ID = PAST UR AWS ACCOUNT ID NUMBER
  - IMAGE_REPO_NAME = the name of the repo in ecr
  - IMAGE_TAG = the tag of ur image in ecr
  - CONTAIANER_NAME = the name of u gave to ur container when creating task
  - region= select ur region

  - click on Buildspec
  - select Use a buildspec file
  - deployspec = buildspec.yml
  - next

# test stage , we donot have it yet just click on next

# deploy stag
  - Deploy provider = amazon ecs
  - region = us-east-1
  - Cluster name = put the name of ur cluster in ecs
  - Service name = the name of the service u created in ecs
  - Image definitions file = imagedefinitions.json
  - next

  - go to iam and creat ur role, look for the role name u created
  - click on iam
  - click on role
  - look for the role
  - click on add permition , select attach policie
  - look for amazonec2containerRegistryfullaccess
  - click add permtion
  - if deployment faild go to buildspec file in github and edit the container name with the container name in ecs
